# google_chrome_custom_web
Code for custom chrome extension that I use. 

A memo for myself. Created out of js html and css. Right now its just a rotating image of a spiral with changing opaque color background. Feel free to use. Theres a lot of pictures you can test with. Personally another one I recommend is wspiral.png.
